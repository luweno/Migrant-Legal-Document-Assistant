# Migrant-Legal-Document-Assistant
This is a project created by @oliverrexx and @zzithu. Sponsored by Hacking Injustice Hackathon.


## Demo
Our goal was to create an assistant for refugees and immigrants whose purpose was to help  them understand their rights and assist in legal documentation to prevent them from being forcibly removed, additionally giving them security in understanding their rights. We wanted to focus on keywords and a both formal and inviting atmosphere. Our demonstration uses Gemini due to the multi-lingual compatibilities, which enhances the inclusive factor.


## Future Goals
We do not plan on ending this project here, as our plans revolve around expanding use cases and customizing the chatbot as a means for more elaborate and accurate conversations.

Additionally, aiding in the settling process for refugees by expanding the tool as an assistant for the dedicated workers at International Insitute of New England.

Furthermore, we want to explore the potential of a 'living situation calculator', which based on the circumstances of the Refugee give options for living, including the price to live in specific locations, expected income, and transportation.
